#build scrabble here


#every if statement must have an else
#never nest if-statements more than 2 deep. That means if you put an if in an if then you should be looking to move that second if into another function

#boolean tests should be simple. I they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable

#the best way to debug a prog is to use puts or p to print out the values of variables at points in the prog. to see where they go wrong

#make sure that parts of your progs. work as you work on them. Do not write massive files of code b4 you try to run them. Code a lil, run a lil, fix a lil

#write up your idea  first b4 coding

#Every programmer becomes paralysed by irrational fear starting a new project. They then use procastination to avoid confronting the fear and end up not getting their prog. working or even started.

#The best way to avoid this is to make a list of things you shuld do, then do them one at a time
