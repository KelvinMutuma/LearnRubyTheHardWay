On line 1 we have what’s called a “require”. This is how you add features to your script from the Ruby feature set or
other sources (e.g., Ruby Gems, stuff you wrote yourself). Rather than give you all the features at once, Ruby asks you
to say what you plan to use. This keeps your programs small, but it also acts as documentation for other programmers
who read your code later.
